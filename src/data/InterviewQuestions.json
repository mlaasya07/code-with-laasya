    "question": "Explain event bubbling and event capturing",
    "answer": "Event bubbling is when an event propagates from the target element up to the root. Event capturing is the opposite - from root down to target. Use addEventListener's third parameter (true) for capturing phase.",

    "question": "What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?",
    "answer": "call() invokes function with given 'this' and arguments separately. apply() is similar but arguments as array. bind() returns a new function with bound 'this' value.",

    "answer": "The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty, then moves callbacks from the callback queue to the stack. Microtasks (Promises) have priority over macrotasks (setTimeout).",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the difference between props and state?",
    "answer": "Props are passed from parent to child and are read-only. State is managed within a component and can be updated, causing re-renders.",

    "id": "react-2",
    "category": "React",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Why is the key prop important in lists?",
    "answer": "Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. Using unique, stable keys improves performance by minimizing DOM operations during reconciliation.",

    "question": "How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?",
    "answer": "React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the new virtual DOM with the previous one. It assumes elements of different types produce different trees and uses keys to match children.",
